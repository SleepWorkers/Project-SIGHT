## Simulink
All [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) files are present below:
- [FlexSensor_voltage_divider.slx](./Simulink/FlexSensor_voltage_divider.slx): Simple voltage divider circuit for converting the flex stress into voltage change.
  - This gave unsatisfactory results
    ![Voltage Divider circuit](../.media/photos/Voltage_divider.png)
- [FlexSensor_Wheatstone_Bridge1.slx](./Simulink/FlexSensor_Wheatstone_Bridge1.slx): Wheatstone bridge used to convert stress into voltage values
  - This also did not give very satisfactory results.
