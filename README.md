# About Project
This project is created for the purpose of participation in [IICDC 2018](https://innovate.mygov.in/india-innovation-challenge-design-contest-2018/) (India Innovation Challenge Design Contest).

The human hand is the most versatile part of the body. We exploit its dexterity to provide a glove that can transcend todayâ€™s wearables by giving an organic feel while interacting with technology. We feel today,the most important and difficult to procure resources are time, money, health & safety. S.I.G.H.T. will safeguard these resources.

We've used the following operating systems in the development of this project. Note that not all operating systems might support all packages of the project.
  - [Ubuntu Xenial](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)
  - [MacOS Mojave](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/mojave/)
